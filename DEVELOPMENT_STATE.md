### Session Update: 2025-09-13 (Continued - Pipeline Fixes)

#### Extraction Pipeline Errors Fixed:
1. ‚úÖ **Fixed ConfigError in extraction_pipeline.py**:
   - Error: `KeyError: 'pipeline_config'` when error handling tried to access non-existent config key
   - Solution: Changed all config access to use safe `.get()` method with defaults
   - Fixed in all 3 stages and checkpoint saving methods
   - Now handles missing config gracefully without crashing

2. ‚úÖ **Fixed Database Access Error in imessage_extractor.py**:
   - Error: `sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file`
   - Root cause: get_chat_mapping() didn't check if file exists or handle missing chat table
   - Solution: Added comprehensive error handling:
     - Check if database file exists before opening
     - Check if file is readable (permissions)
     - Verify chat table exists (handles case of no group chats)
     - Graceful SQLite error handling with logging
     - Returns empty dict instead of crashing on errors

3. ‚úÖ **Created Diagnostic and Fix Scripts**:
   - `diagnostic_scripts/diagnose_pipeline_issue.py` - Comprehensive diagnostics
   - `fix_pipeline_comprehensive.py` - Automated fix application
   - Both scripts test imports and verify fixes work correctly

#### Technical Details:
- The pipeline was failing because it tried to access `self.config['pipeline_config']['continue_on_error']` in exception handlers
- If the initial config was incomplete or an early error occurred, this would cause a secondary KeyError
- The database issue occurred when the chat table doesn't exist (no group chats in iMessage)
- All config access now uses safe patterns: `self.config.get('pipeline_config', {}).get('key', default)`

#### Files Modified:
- `src/pipelines/extraction_pipeline.py` - Safe config access throughout
- `src/imessage_extractor.py` - Robust database handling in get_chat_mapping()
- Created diagnostic and fix scripts for future use

#### Next Steps:
1. ‚è≥ Run the extraction pipeline with fixes applied
2. ‚è≥ Monitor for any additional edge cases
3. ‚è≥ Consider adding unit tests for error conditions
4. ‚è≥ Update documentation if needed

### Session Update: 2025-09-13 (Continued - SQLite WAL Fix)

#### SQLite Database Access Error Fixed:
1. ‚úÖ **Fixed "unable to open database file" error in imessage_extractor.py**:
   - **Root Cause**: SQLite WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) files were not being copied
   - **Issue**: chat.db uses WAL mode which requires chat.db-wal and chat.db-shm files
   - **Symptoms**: 
     - File copies successfully but SQLite can't open it
     - Permissions show as `-rwx------@` with extended attributes
     - Error occurs immediately after copy when trying to query
   
2. ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Fix Applied**:
   - **WAL File Handling**: Now copies chat.db-wal and chat.db-shm files if they exist
   - **Extended Attributes**: Removes macOS quarantine flags using `xattr -c`
   - **Permissions**: Changed from restrictive 0o640 to 0o644 for better read access
   - **Journal Mode Conversion**: Optionally converts from WAL to DELETE mode
     - This consolidates the database and removes WAL dependency
     - Makes the database more portable
   - **Logging**: Added detailed logging for each step of the process

3. ‚úÖ **Created Diagnostic Tools**:
   - `diagnose_sqlite_issue.py` - Comprehensive SQLite diagnostic
     - Checks file attributes and permissions
     - Detects WAL/SHM files
     - Tests SQLite connections
     - Provides fix suggestions
   - `fix_sqlite_wal_issue.py` - Automated fix application (now integrated)

#### Technical Details:
- SQLite in WAL mode maintains a write-ahead log for performance
- The WAL file contains recent changes not yet written to main database
- Without WAL file, SQLite can't access recent data and fails to open
- macOS extended attributes (@ flag) can prevent database access
- Converting to DELETE journal mode consolidates all data into main file

#### Files Modified:
- `src/imessage_extractor.py` - Enhanced copy_databases_secure() method
  - Added WAL/SHM file copying
  - Added extended attribute removal
  - Changed permissions to 0o644
  - Added journal mode conversion

#### Testing Notes:
- The fix handles both WAL and non-WAL databases
- Works even if WAL files don't exist (graceful fallback)
- xattr command failures are ignored (not available on all systems)
- Journal mode conversion is optional (continues if it fails)

#### Next Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Run the extraction pipeline to verify the fix works
2. ‚è≥ Monitor for any edge cases with different SQLite configurations
3. ‚è≥ Consider adding unit tests for database copying
4. ‚è≥ Update documentation with troubleshooting guide

---
### Session Update: 2025-09-13 (Continued - SQLite Query Execution Fix)

#### SQLite "unable to open database file" During Query Fixed:
1. ‚úÖ **Root Cause Identified**: 
   - Error occurred during query execution, not connection
   - Attached databases referenced files that don't exist
   - WAL mode wasn't fully consolidated
   - JOIN operations failed on copied database

2. ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Fix Applied to extract_messages()**:
   - **Read-Only Mode**: Uses `file:db?mode=ro&immutable=1` URI connection
   - **Detach Databases**: Automatically detaches any attached databases
   - **Query Fallback**: Falls back to simpler query without JOIN if needed
   - **Better Error Handling**: Logs connection modes and query failures
   - **Thread Safety**: Added `check_same_thread=False` for stability

3. ‚úÖ **Enhanced WAL Checkpoint in copy_databases_secure()**:
   - **TRUNCATE Checkpoint**: Uses `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` for full consolidation
   - **Delete WAL Files**: Removes WAL/SHM files after successful conversion
   - **Better Logging**: Tracks each step of the conversion process

4. ‚úÖ **Created Test and Diagnostic Tools**:
   - `test_sqlite_fixes.py` - Comprehensive test of the extraction with fixes
   - `diagnose_sqlite_detailed.py` - Detailed diagnostic for debugging
   - `fix_sqlite_cli_approach.py` - Alternative using sqlite3 CLI tool

#### Technical Solution Details:
- **URI Connection**: SQLite URI mode allows specifying read-only and immutable flags
- **Immutable Flag**: Prevents any write attempts, even temporary ones
- **Detach Databases**: Removes references to missing attached database files
- **Query Simplification**: Removes JOIN when handle table is inaccessible
- **WAL Truncation**: Forces all WAL data to be written to main database file

#### Files Modified:
- `src/imessage_extractor.py`:
  - `extract_messages()` - Complete rewrite with read-only mode and fallbacks
  - `copy_databases_secure()` - Enhanced WAL checkpoint and file cleanup

#### Testing:
- Run `python3 test_sqlite_fixes.py` to verify the fixes work
- The test extracts 10 messages and verifies database accessibility
- Checks for proper file creation and permissions

#### Next Steps:
1. ‚è≥ Run full extraction pipeline with `--limit 5000`
2. ‚è≥ Test with different message database sizes
3. ‚è≥ Create unit tests for edge cases
4. ‚è≥ Document troubleshooting steps in guide

---
### Session Update: 2025-09-13 (Continued - Database Malformed Fix)

#### "Database disk image is malformed" Error:
1. ‚úÖ **Root Cause**: WAL checkpoint was corrupting the database
   - Modifying a copied WAL database can cause corruption
   - The checkpoint operation was trying to consolidate an inconsistent state
   - WAL files might not be in sync when copied

2. ‚úÖ **Fix Applied**:
   - **Removed Checkpoint Code**: No longer try to modify copied database
   - **Keep Original State**: Database copied as-is with WAL files
   - **Read-Only Access**: Using read-only mode for queries
   - **No Modifications**: Don't delete WAL/SHM files after copy

3. ‚úÖ **Alternative Solution Created**:
   - **sqlite3 CLI Backup**: Use `.backup` command for clean copies
   - **Test Script**: `test_cli_backup.py` to verify CLI method
   - **Fallback**: Regular file copy if CLI not available

#### Testing Tools Created:
- `test_cli_backup.py` - Test sqlite3 CLI backup method
- `fix_malformed_database.py` - Fix using CLI approach
- `test_alternative_copy.py` - Alternative copy methods
- `apply_final_database_fix.py` - Apply the no-modification fix

#### Current Status:
- Checkpoint code removed from `copy_databases_secure()`
- Database files copied without modification
- Read-only mode used for queries
- sqlite3 CLI backup method available as alternative

#### To Resolve:
1. Run `python3 test_cli_backup.py` to test CLI method
2. If CLI works, it's the most reliable solution
3. Otherwise, the current no-modification approach should work
4. Test with `python3 test_sqlite_fixes.py`

   - Even with Full Disk Access, queries fail on network storage
   - Issue specific to `/Volumes/FS001/` (network-mounted NAS)
   - Local storage (`/tmp`) works perfectly

2. ‚úÖ **Not a Corruption Issue**: 
   - Database files copy correctly
   - File sizes and content are intact
   - Issue occurs during SQLite query execution, not file access
   - The "unable to open database file" error is misleading

3. ‚úÖ **Temporary Solution Applied**:
   - Created `run_with_local_storage.py` script
   - Uses `/tmp` for database operations
   - Copies results back to NAS after processing
   - Successfully extracts messages
