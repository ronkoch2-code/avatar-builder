   - Automatic cleanup of old data (30-day retention)

4. **Alerting System**:
   - Threshold monitoring (warning at 80%, critical at 95%)
   - Daily limit tracking (default 1M tokens)
   - Automatic logging of threshold violations

5. **Reporting**:
   - CLI commands: `report`, `balance`, `summary`, `cleanup`
   - Multiple formats: text, JSON, CSV
   - Detailed or compact session summaries

6. **Pipeline Integration**:
   - Automatic capture of before/after balances
   - Delta calculation and display
   - Token usage included in pipeline results

#### Usage Examples:
```bash
# Check token balance
python3 src/token_monitor.py balance

# Generate 7-day report
python3 src/token_monitor.py report --days 7 --format text

# Show current session summary
python3 src/token_monitor.py summary

# Clean old data
python3 src/token_monitor.py cleanup --days 30
```

#### Next Steps:
1. ⏳ Write unit tests for TokenMonitor class
2. ⏳ Test with actual Anthropic API calls
3. ⏳ Add configuration file support
4. ⏳ Create documentation for token monitoring
5. ⏳ Consider web dashboard for visualization

### Session Update: 2025-09-28 - Rate Limiting Improvements

#### Problem:
Excessive 429 "Too Many Requests" errors from Anthropic API causing delays.

#### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Created adaptive rate limiter with token bucket algorithm
2. ✅ Reduced concurrent API calls from 2 to 1
3. ✅ Lowered rate limit to 10 calls/minute (conservative)
4. ✅ Added automatic backoff on 429 errors
5. ✅ Implemented adaptive rate adjustment based on success ratio
6. ✅ Added 1-second delay between relationship analyses

#### New Features:
- **AdaptiveRateLimiter class**: Automatically adjusts rate based on API responses
- **Token bucket algorithm**: Smooth rate limiting with burst support
- **Exponential backoff**: Automatically backs off on repeated 429 errors
- **Performance tracking**: Monitors success ratio and adjusts accordingly

#### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/rate_limiter.py` - New adaptive rate limiting module
- `src/llm_integrator.py` - Integrated rate limiter
- `src/enhanced_avatar_pipeline.py` - Reduced concurrency
- `src/pipelines/extraction_pipeline.py` - Set max_concurrent to 1

### Session Update: 2025-09-28 - LLM Integration Issue RESOLVED

#### Problem Identified:
The extraction pipeline was not making Anthropic API calls even with `--enable-llm` flag because:
1. **Wrong class used**: Pipeline imported `AvatarSystemManager` which has NO LLM support
2. **Enhanced version exists but unused**: `EnhancedAvatarSystemManager` has full LLM integration but wasn't imported
3. **Method incompatibility**: Enhanced version uses different methods (`batch_create_profiles` vs `initialize_all_people`)

#### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Added import for `EnhancedAvatarSystemManager` 
2. ✅ Modified `run_stage_3_profiling()` to detect `enable_llm` flag
3. ✅ When LLM enabled and API key present:
   - Uses `EnhancedAvatarSystemManager` with Anthropic integration
   - Runs async batch processing with `batch_create_profiles`
   - Limits to 5 people initially for cost control
   - Tracks token usage and costs
4. ✅ Added clear console output showing LLM status
5. ✅ Falls back gracefully if API key missing

#### How to Use:
```bash
# Set your API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'

# Run with LLM enhancement
python3 src/pipelines/extraction_pipeline.py --enable-llm --stage profile

# Or full pipeline with LLM
python3 src/pipelines/extraction_pipeline.py --enable-llm --limit 1000
```

#### Key Files Modified:
- `src/pipelines/extraction_pipeline.py` - Added LLM integration logic
- Now properly uses `EnhancedAvatarSystemManager` when `--enable-llm` flag is set
- Token monitoring automatically activates with LLM usage
