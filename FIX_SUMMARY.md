# Model Update Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified
The system was using an outdated Claude model identifier (`claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`) that is no longer supported by the Anthropic API, resulting in 404 errors.

## Solution Applied
Updated the model identifier to the current Claude 4 version: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`

## Files Modified
1. **src/config_manager.py** - Updated default model name
2. **CHANGELOG.md** - Documented fix in version 1.0.1

## New Utilities Added
1. **fix_model_config.py** - Updates your existing configuration file
2. **update_system.py** - Complete system update and verification
3. **commit_model_fix.sh** - Git commit script for the changes
4. **git_push_ready.sh** - Complete git preparation and push script

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Update your configuration
```bash
python3 fix_model_config.py
```

### Step 2: Verify the system
```bash
python3 update_system.py
```

### Step 3: Test the fix
```bash
python3 enhanced_deployment.py --analyze-person "Aisling Murphy" --force
```

### Step 4: Push to GitHub
```bash
chmod +x git_push_ready.sh
./git_push_ready.sh
git push origin main
```

## What This Fixes
- ✅ 404 Not Found errors from Anthropic API
- ✅ RetryError exceptions during analysis
- ✅ Failed personality analysis
- ✅ Failed relationship analysis
- ✅ Zero cost reporting (because no API calls were succeeding)

## Important Notes
- Make sure your Anthropic API key is still configured in `~/.avatar-engine/avatar_config.json`
- The new model (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) is the current Claude Sonnet 4 version from May 2025
- All existing functionality remains the same, just with the corrected model identifier

## Version
This fix is released as version **1.0.2** of the Avatar Engine.
