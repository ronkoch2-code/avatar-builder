# Enhanced Deployment Script Fix Notes

## Issue Fixed
The `enhanced_deployment.py` script had an async/await issue where the main() function was declared as async but called with `asyncio.run()`, which could cause event loop conflicts.

## Solution Applied
1. Changed `async def main()` to regular `def main()`
2. For async operations (analyze_person, analyze_all_people), we now create a new event loop explicitly:
   ```python
   loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
   asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
   try:
       result = loop.run_until_complete(async_function())
   finally:
       loop.close()
   ```
3. Removed `asyncio.run(main())` and now call `main()` directly
4. Added proper logging configuration at startup

## Testing
Run `python3 test_enhanced_deployment.py` to verify the fixes work correctly.

## Usage
```bash
# Configure system (first time only)
python3 src/config_manager.py

# Deploy enhanced schema
python3 enhanced_deployment.py --deploy

# Check system status
python3 enhanced_deployment.py --status

# List people available for analysis
python3 enhanced_deployment.py --list-people

# Analyze a specific person
python3 enhanced_deployment.py --analyze-person "Person Name"

# Analyze all people (with limits)
python3 enhanced_deployment.py --analyze-all --max-people 5
```

## Key Features
- Fixed async/await handling for proper event loop management
- Supports both sync and async operations seamlessly
- Better error handling and logging
- Cost monitoring with Anthropic API (prompt caching and batch API support)
- Neo4j integration for knowledge graph storage
