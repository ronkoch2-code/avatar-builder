# Commit with comprehensive message
git commit -m "feat: Add message data loader pipeline

- Integrated message loading functionality from iMessage Autoprocessor  
- Added support for SQLite and JSON data sources
- Implemented sophisticated message text cleaning
- Created batch processing for efficient data loading
- Added comprehensive documentation
- Established Neo4j graph structure (Person, Message, GroupChat nodes)
- Included command-line interface and Python API
- Resolves missing pipeline functionality for data extraction and loading

This restores the critical functionality for loading message data
from external sources into Neo4j, which was previously in a separate
project directory. The loader is now fully integrated into Avatar-Engine."
